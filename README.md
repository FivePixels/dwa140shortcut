## About
This project was written in Swift. I've always used USB WiFi with my Hackintosh, and with this, I was required to use these "Drivers" that rig the system to send a connection through the Ethernet port. This application creates a menu icon that shows an accurate icon for your current connected state. It also contains other options, such as a button to update the status (by restarting the application) and a shortcut to the DWA-140 Preference Pane, as well as the Networks Preference Pane.
