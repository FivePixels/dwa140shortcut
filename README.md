# dwa140shortcut

A simple menu bar application to expedite usage of the DWA-140 preference pane. This application is especially useful for users with a Hackintosh computer build.

## Why dwa140shortcut?

I created this application for personal use on my macOS machine that relies on the DWA-140 preference pane. It become a task opening System Preferences, opening the pane, waiting for it to load, and hoping that my connection would be successful. (The pane itself isn't the most accurate)

With this application, you are presented with a menubar icon that represents the current state of your network, as normal macOS also does. If you do not have a desirable network card, macOS doesn't give you the option to use the default WiFi menubar.

If you're using a USB WiFi dongle on macOS, you're more than likely downloading a driver patch for your system. This patch usually routes traffic from the dongle to your ethernet controller, connecting you to the internet. 

## Features

* Easy "shortcut" button to the DWA-140 preference pane.
* Easy "shortcut" button to the Network Preferences preference pane.
* Ability to refresh the current status of your network connection.

### Other macOS versions

Currently, I do not have full support for any version below macOS 10.12. I plan in the future to add full support but some of the frameworks I'm depending on only work above 10.12.

I have created a specific version temporarily for 10.10 [here](https://github.com/FivePixels/dwa140shortcut/issues/1#issuecomment-449897887).

## Upcoming Features
- [x] Toggle to enable application as soon as the user logs in.
- [ ] Update the menubar correctly, without needing to reload the application.
- [ ] Update the menubar accurately according to range.
- [ ] Perform a check to make sure the connection isn't captive, and if it is, present the user with an error letting them know.
